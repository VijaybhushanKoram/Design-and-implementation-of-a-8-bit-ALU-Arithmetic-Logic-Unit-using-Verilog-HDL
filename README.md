# Design-and-implementation-of-a-8-bit-ALU-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-using-Verilog-HDL
In this project, we will design and implement a 8-bit ALU using Verilog HDL. The ALU will perform basic arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and complement. We will implement the ALU using combinational logic, which means that it will not have any internal state.
